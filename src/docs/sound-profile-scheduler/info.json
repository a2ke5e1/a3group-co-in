      "review": "Really useful and unique 'year progress' countdown timers, along with custom events. I particularly like the all-in-one circular widget which looks great on my home screen. The only change I would like is a larger text option",

It's a real eye-opener to how quickly time passes. This is a brilliant concept, well-executed by the developer. Thank you for creating such a helpful tool!",
